<h2>About Me...</h2>
<p class="lead">
A developer, for web, server and even data.
</p>
<p>
I write mostly in Python, Java, Javascript and Go currently, but I'm always on the look out for new up and coming technologies.
</p>
<p>
  I have a great deal of experience with AWS EC2 instances writing simple, clean and performant code.
</p>
<p>
  
</p>
<p>
  At some point in the near future I'm thinking about doing some freelance work; contact me at "freelance @ 0xdb.co.uk" if you think you might have something appealing.
